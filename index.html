                <h2>Soraia Felício</h2>
                <p> I have been living in Portugal for 3 years and have a passion for learning and adapting to new
                    challenges. Throughout my professional journey, I have primarily focused on software development,
                    amassing more than 25 years of experience in this domain. While currently exploring the realm of
                    data science, which aligns with my existing skills and expertise, I am equally passionate about
                    application development. Therefore, working in this area brings me immense joy and satisfaction.

            <h2>About my career</h2>
            <p>Nothing brings me greater joy than developing software. Witnessing the software I have created being
                utilized by numerous individuals and making a meaningful impact on their lives amplifies my happiness
                even further. My eagerness to learn is insatiable, and I am always seeking out new knowledge. My journey
                thus far has encompassed an array of programming languages, including older ones like Pascal, COBOL, and
                Delphi, as well as contemporary ones like PHP, C/C++, Java, and Python. Among these languages, I harbor
                a special fondness for Python. I have worked with Symphony in PHP and TurboGears, Web2Py, and Django in
                Python. Furthermore, I possess significant expertise in SQL, having crafted functions and procedures
                centered around businesses using PL/SQL from Oracle, as well as MySQL and PostgreSQL. Additionally, I
                have taught programming classes in open courses and colleges, covering almost all of the previously
                mentioned languages, including workshops. At present, I have developed multiple machine learning
                algorithms, explored data mining techniques and intelligent systems approaches, and leveraged
                statistical methodologies to scrutinize research data that I have contributed to.</p>
